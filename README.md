# CTCI Study Guide - Table of Contents 
An open source study guide based on the book called _"Cracking The Coding Interview"_. These are the 8 chapters that I believe one must review or study before a technical interview or an online assessment. 
1. Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
2. Chapter 2: Linked Lists
3. Chapter 3: Stacks and Queues
4. Chapter 4: Trees and Graphs
5. Chapter 8: Recursion and Dynamic Programming
6. Chapter 10: Sorting and Searching
7. Chpater 16: Moderate
8. Chapter 17: Hard

Some of the chapters have been omitted on this list since they are not the typical Data Structure and Algorithm interview question. Nontheless, it is probably a good idea to review those chapters as well.
